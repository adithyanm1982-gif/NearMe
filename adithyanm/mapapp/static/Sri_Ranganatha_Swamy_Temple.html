The Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam is one of the most important and magnificent temples in India, dedicated to **Lord Ranganatha**, a reclining form of Lord Vishnu resting on the cosmic serpent **Adisesha**. Situated on Srirangam island between the rivers **Cauvery and Kollidam**, the temple’s geography adds to its sacred character and historical resilience. Spanning about **156 acres**, it is the **largest functioning Hindu temple complex in the world**, designed as a vast temple-city with **seven concentric enclosures**, massive walls, broad streets, and towering gopurams, the tallest rising over 70 meters. The temple is a central seat of **Sri Vaishnavism** and one of the **108 Divya Desams**, celebrated by the Alvar saints and shaped intellectually by Ramanujacharya. With its ancient inscriptions, intricate sculptures, grand halls, and uninterrupted traditions of worship and festivals, the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple stands as a living symbol of South India’s spiritual depth, architectural brilliance, and cultural continuity across centuries.
