Tiruchirappalli International Airport (TRZ) is a major aviation hub for central Tamil Nadu, playing a crucial role in connecting the region with key domestic cities and important international destinations, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Located about five kilometers south of Tiruchirappalli city, the airport supports tourism, religious travel to Srirangam and nearby heritage sites, and overseas employment-linked travel. With a modern passenger terminal, upgraded infrastructure, and growing flight operations, it handles a steady flow of passengers and cargo, contributing significantly to regional trade and economic development. As one of the few international airports in Tamil Nadu outside Chennai, Trichy Airport stands as a strategic gateway that strengthens connectivity, commerce, and cultural exchange for the region.
